This is a 3D Renderer project made from Scratch in C using SDL. 
I followed Gustavo Pezzi's [3D Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) course for this project. 

### Summary
In the repository there are two folders.
The first one is the Mac/Linux implementation that you can open with any terminal, giving that you have SDL2 installed on your device. 

The second one is the Windows implementation with its corresponding Visual Studio project. 

I initially started working on the Windows implementation but moved to Mac/Linux because it was easier for me to setup on the devices I had available at the moment. 
The Windows implementation is not finished.
